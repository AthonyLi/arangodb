!SECTION Distributed deployment using Apache Mesos

Philosophie: Es muss extrem einfach aussehen, trotzdem sollte die Section
hinreichend viel Detailinformation liefern. Ich wei√ü, dass das ein 
Widerspruch ist.

!SUBSECTION DC/OS

Explain that ArangoDB is in "the universe" and can be launched under 
"Services" in the UI. 

Show how one reaches the coordinator UI via the DC/OS UI after deployment.

Explain about scaling up and down via the UI.

Explain configuration options or link to some place where they are
explained.

Explain about the `dcos` CLI and the ArangoDB `dcos`-subcommand.

Explain how to shut down an ArangoDB cluster cleanly.

Say that ArangoDB uses persistent volumes, explain advantage.

Say that this makes it impossible to deploy ArangoDB to "public Mesos Agents".
Explain how to setup a marathon-lb load balancer to reach the coordinators
either from within the DC/OS cluster or from the outside (via public slaves).

Explain authentication setup (once we have it).

Staubsauger?

!SUBSECTION Apache Mesos and Marathon

Explain how to launch an ArangoDB cluster via Marathon in an Apache
Mesos cluster.

Explain configuration options or link to some place where they are
explained.

Show how one reaches the coordinator UI, HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY WORK?
DO WE NEED EXPLAIN ABOUT sshuttle?

Mention scaling up and down as in DC/OS case.

Explain how to shut down an ArangoDB cluster cleanly.

Explain authentication setup (once we have it) or say it is exactly as
in the DC/OS case.

Staubsauger? Deployment via Marathon.
